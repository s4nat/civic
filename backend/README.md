# civic

## Overview


## Features

- **Comprehensive API Routing**: Dedicated routes for handling anomalies, devices, users, and data streams.
- **IoT Integration**: Initialization and communication with IoT devices through MQTT protocol.
- **Cron Jobs**: Scheduled tasks for anomaly checking and data maintenance.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Configured to allow requests from different origins.
- **Error Handling**: Middleware for centralized error handling.

## Prerequisites

## Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the server locally with:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

This will start the application on the default port `8080` or on a port defined in your `.env` file.

### IoT Device Initialization

The application automatically attempts to initialize configured IoT devices on startup, ensuring they are ready to communicate and transmit data.

### API Endpoints

The server defines multiple routes for various functionalities:

- `/anomalies` - Anomaly reports and management.
- `/devices` - Device registration and management.
- `/users` - User account management.
- `/datastreams` - Data stream management.
- `/sagemakerAnomalies` - Anomaly detection through Amazon SageMaker.

### Scheduled Tasks

Two cron jobs are configured for regular operations:

- Anomaly checking
- Data maintenance

These are accessible via `/anomalyChecker/cron` and `/clearData/cron` endpoints.

## Development

Contributions are welcome. Ensure adherence to coding standards and submit pull requests for any enhancements or bug fixes.

### Testing

The application includes a basic test setup:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment with Vercel, leveraging the settings in `vercel.json`. Refer to the [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) for deployment instructions.
